# Sustaining Propolis

## Base Economic Functions

Propolis aims to be a versatile structure that can be applied to many 
diverse applications by and for the people that begin and operate any 
particular instance of it and as such it cannot be too specific in certain 
areas of operation. The diagram above excludes these areas which consist of 
the ideas and principles, political party and education departments and 
their satellites because the nature of these departments will be heavily 
influenced by the purpose of the instance being created. For example an 
instance created in order to manage and upgrade the living standards of 
some insurance industry focused members would have different needs than one 
focused on the green technology community. All this being said there are 
areas of operation that can be more simply defined as they will be more 
broadly necessary. The structure shown above outlines the general business 
model by which Propolis instances aim to remain sustainable. To maintain 
the possibility of interoperability the base economic functions of Propolis 
instances should closely adhere to each other. This will enable the 
departments from different instances to become interchangeable between 
instances using a protocol based cascading economic networking structure 
that can operate between departments, satellites, members, or any other 
type of Propolis node with great efficiency. Such an operational paradigm 
would allow for many advantageous practices, for example, members with 
appropriate departmental training would be able to transfer their skills 
between Propolis nodes without the necessity of acclimatising to a new 
system. Another example could be that of a nested instance of a Propolis 
structure which is managed within the profitable enterprises department of 
its parent instance could omit the creation of any unnecessary departments 
for its operation and retain access to these departments functionality by 
having its members also being taken as members of the parent instance. This 
would give them access to all the benefits of Propolis membership without 
the necessity of running extraneous departments for their operation. To 
illustrate this, it should be obvious that a team of graphic designers who 
choose to run on a Propolis framework would have no need of a political 
party, credit union or other nodes except the ones that will be used to 
manage their business, namely the 'human care and development' and 
'profitable enterprises' nodes. This nodal pairing should compose the 
minimum possible combination of nodes required to operate an instance of 
Propolis. Ideally these minimal instances would be in the previously stated 
parent/child nested enterprise configuration however that should not be a 
requirement as the widespread adoption of Propolis as a framework is to be 
desired, to this end organisations that adopt framework compliance and meet 
set requirements should have made available to them a method of integration 
as a child instance of a larger more established instance. Other beneficial 
services could be made available to Propolis Compliant startups such as 
credit union services such as accounts and accountancy at desirable rates 
or educational resources, this is possible because the underlying system 
running the startup is well known from the outset because by definition 
they are compliant. This will allow administrative efficiency freeing the 
startup's members to focus on its core activity. There will be innumerable 
other benefits that could be invented to encourage the adoption of the 
Propolis framework, going forward it will be our task to define these.

## Nodes and Sub-Nodes

While the items shown in the diagram above need not all exist in all 
instances of Propolis they should all exist in the prime instance. Not only 
because as the model example of the framework it is valuable to demonstrate 
the functional workings but mainly because there must be an extant node or 
sub-node of each type so that nested instances may utilise the previously 
described cascading functionalities. The focus of this document will 
continue in the description of the prime instance as it will be this that 
lays the groundwork for future instances and provides the cascading 
functionalities future child instances may wish to utilise. The main 
concerns of each department are outlined in rounded rectangular boxes and 
are appended with some of their properties. The smaller sharp cornered 
rectangles detail support teams that work to accommodate the main concerns 
within the department or satellite they serve. These rectangles are sub-
nodes as they depend on a department to support them, the departments and 
satellites are nodes as are the committees that run the departments and are 
represented as circles. Councils when they are sitting are also nodes. 
External entities that require a level of interaction are shown as double 
outlined rectangles. The ellipses show the outcomes that will be produced 
by the departments and satellites, their positions on the diagram are 
mapped to the area that will be most interested in them, and in most 
instances manage them.

## Income/Costs

While this all aims to illustrate the possibilities for sustainability that 
Propolis could utilise there is by no means a fully comprehensive view of 
the full organisational model here, and explicitly not of the higher 
operations as much of them have been omitted from the diagram. The reason 
for this is twofold, firstly it will be important to become economically 
stable from the outset with economic mechanisms in place to deal with the 
base needs of members so focusing on the economics is the priority, and 
secondly because it is important for the development of Propolis to be 
member driven as this is the only way to achieve a healthy open source 
ecosystem. The economic mechanisms outlined here should also be strongly 
scrutinised and amended with rational improvements before deployment. 
However it may be changed this proposed system does seek to provide an 
outline of a complete organisation that has avenues for income and costs 
defined. The main concerns shown in the rounded rectangles can be seen as a 
combination of income and cost as they will have costly requirements but 
also be generative of the income or stability of Propolis as a whole. In 
terms of the diagram, there is a colour coding in place which shows sources 
of income or valuable outcomes in green and destinations for outgoings in 
red. The representation of the financial markets are coloured yellow 
because its state in terms of profitability will be in flux.

## Reward Structure

The level of operation of Propolis should quickly become comparable to the 
medium-large businesses currently seen in modern economies and will need to 
have a structure in place to reward and accommodate members. In basic terms 
this comes down to pay in the modern world, and membership of Propolis 
should be comparable in that regard, but other forms of wealth exist as 
noted earlier, so Propolis could seek to offer its members benefits in 
other areas in addition to financial wealth, this could include vehicular 
support, provision of housing or premises, IT support, care provision plus 
myriad others. It should be the case that people are provided for fairly, 
without shareholders more profit will be available to return to members. 
One particularly valuable thing Propolis could provide its members would be 
the opportunity for them to bring in anyone else of their choosing into 
Propolis as a supported member. This could be anyone from a child to an 
elderly relative who would receive Propolis member benefits at no 
obligation to them. The purpose of this membership level is to enable 
patron members to have peace of mind knowing they have provided 
indefinitely for that person. By this mechanism members may attain better 
mental health knowing that their loved ones are provided for indefinitely 
which itself is a form of wealth that affects organisations directly as 
they rely on brain power and personal stability of their staff. It would be 
the case that those brought in by this method may choose to engage further 
with Propolis and become contributing members for their own reasons but 
they should never be obliged to. A separate set of mechanisms should be 
derived for attracting members directly as contributing or otherwise. The 
interconnected nature of Propolis should in itself provide a level of 
access to any enterprise or outcome to all members such that membership 
itself is a form of wealth. With proper organisation the attraction of 
membership itself should be a major driving force for the growth of 
Propolis. The attraction to businesses would be the ability to act as if 
part of a large corporation without the loss of autonomy. The attraction 
for the individual would be the ability to manage the provision of their 
labour again with autonomy preserved. Whichever forms wealth may take it is 
important that Propolis does not create conditions that could produce 
obscenely wealthy individuals, the presence of such in the modern world is 
indicative of a failure at a systematic level, especially when juxtaposed 
to the mass suffering encountered in large parts of the world. The goal of 
Propolis is to provide its members with a higher state of living than is 
currently available to most people during the capitalist decline and the 
existence of such individuals necessarily comes at the expense of the many. 
By utilising the supported membership provisions as a chief mechanism for 
reward the most productive would be rewarded by directly shaping the 
Propolis wider society.
