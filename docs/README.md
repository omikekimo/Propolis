# Propolis

> An open source framework for decentralised autonomous organisations

## What is Propolis?

Propolis is an open source framework for instantiating a network of 
decentralised autonomous organisations designed to provide its members with 
a higher state of living than is currently available to most people during 
the capitalist decline. 

We actively use information and policies acquired from traditional and 
novel sources to model a sustainable work/life paradigm which will be 
beneficial to the humans involved. The organisation dynamically forms 
structures to promote and execute profitable enterprises, with profits 
retained for use by the members/workers/Propolis rather than being sent to 
shareholders as is the incumbent paradigm.

## Core Principles

With co-operative development as seen in the open source movement which has 
resulted in massive successes in the technology sector alongside successes 
evident from existing co-operative organisations in many sectors, we seek 
to develop Propolis into a **scalable social operating system** suitable to 
supplement or replace legacy governance and regulatory systems.

## Why "Propolis"?

The name is inspired by the protective resinous substance that bees create 
to strengthen and protect their hives - it's also a wordplay on 
"professional city". Just as bees use propolis to create a resilient, 
adaptive structure, this framework aims to create resilient, adaptive 
organisational structures for humans.
