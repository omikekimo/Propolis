# Propolis Specification

Propolis is an open source framework for instantiating a network of 
decentralised autonomous organisations designed to provide its members with 
a higher state of living than is currently available to most people during 
the capitalist decline. We will actively use information and policies 
acquired from traditional and novel sources to model a sustainable 
work/life paradigm which will be beneficial to the humans involved. The 
organisation will dynamically form structures to promote and execute 
profitable enterprises, profits from such activities will be retained for 
use by the members/workers/Propolis rather than being sent to shareholders 
as is the incumbent paradigm. With co-operative development as seen in the 
open source movement which has resulted in massive successes in the 
technology sector alongside successes evident from existing co-operative 
organisations in many sectors, we seek to develop Propolis into a scalable 
social operating system suitable to supplement or replace legacy governance 
and regulatory systems.
