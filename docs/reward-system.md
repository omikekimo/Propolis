# Reward System

## Comparable to Medium-Large Business

The level of operation of Propolis should quickly become comparable to the 
medium-large businesses currently seen in modern economies and will need to 
have a structure in place to reward and accommodate members.

---

## Financial Rewards

### Basic Pay

In basic terms this comes down to pay in the modern world, and membership 
of Propolis should be comparable in that regard.

### Without Shareholders

Without shareholders, more profit will be available to return to members.

---

## Beyond Financial Wealth

Other forms of wealth exist beyond money, so Propolis could seek to offer 
its members benefits in other areas in addition to financial wealth.

### Examples of Non-Financial Benefits

- **Vehicular support** - Access to shared vehicles or assistance with 
transport
- **Provision of housing or premises** - Affordable accommodation or 
workspace
- **IT support** - Technical assistance and infrastructure
- **Care provision** - Childcare, eldercare, healthcare support
- **Plus myriad others** - The scope is limited only by member needs and 
organisational capacity

### Fair Provision

It should be the case that people are provided for fairly.

## Supported Membership

### A Unique Benefit

One particularly valuable thing Propolis could provide its members would be 
the opportunity for them to bring in anyone else of their choosing into 
Propolis as a **supported member**.

### Who Can Be Supported

This could be anyone from:
- A child
- An elderly relative
- A partner
- A friend
- Anyone the patron member chooses

### Benefits of Supported Membership

Supported members would:
- Receive Propolis member benefits
- Have no obligation to contribute
- Be provided for indefinitely by their patron

### Purpose

The purpose of this membership level is to enable patron members to have 
**peace of mind** knowing they have provided indefinitely for that person.

### Mental Health and Stability

By this mechanism members may attain better mental health knowing that 
their loved ones are provided for indefinitely - which itself is a form of 
wealth that affects organisations directly as they rely on brain power and 
personal stability of their staff.

### Pathway to Contribution

It would be the case that those brought in by this method may choose to 
engage further with Propolis and become contributing members for their own 
reasons but **they should never be obliged to**.

---

## Attracting Members

A separate set of mechanisms should be derived for attracting members 
directly as contributing or otherwise.

### Network Effects

The interconnected nature of Propolis should in itself provide a level of 
access to any enterprise or outcome to all members such that **membership 
itself is a form of wealth**.

With proper organisation the attraction of membership itself should be a 
major driving force for the growth of Propolis.

### For Businesses

The attraction to businesses would be the ability to **act as if part of a 
large corporation without the loss of autonomy**.

### For Individuals

The attraction for the individual would be the ability to **manage the 
provision of their labour again with autonomy preserved**.

---

## Preventing Inequality

### No Obscene Wealth

Whichever forms wealth may take it is important that **Propolis does not 
create conditions that could produce obscenely wealthy individuals**.

The presence of such in the modern world is indicative of a failure at a 
systematic level, especially when juxtaposed to the mass suffering 
encountered in large parts of the world.

### The Goal

The goal of Propolis is to provide its members with a higher state of 
living than is currently available to most people during the capitalist 
decline.

The existence of obscenely wealthy individuals necessarily comes at the 
expense of the many.

### Mechanism for Fairness

By utilising the **supported membership provisions as a chief mechanism for 
reward**, the most productive would be rewarded by directly shaping the 
Propolis wider society.

This allows productive members to:
- Support those they care about
- Build a stronger community
- Create wealth that benefits others rather than hoarding it
- Feel fulfilled by seeing the positive impact of their work

## Wealth Distribution Philosophy

### Holistic Approach

True wealth encompasses:
- Financial security
- Free time
- Strong relationships
- Peace of mind
- Community support
- Access to resources
- Personal autonomy
- Health and wellbeing

### Equalisation Over Accumulation

Rather than allowing unlimited accumulation by a few, Propolis aims to:
- Raise the baseline for all members
- Equalise access to resources and opportunities
- Reward contribution with the ability to support others
- Create a rising tide that lifts all boats

This approach recognises that **individual success is meaningless without 
collective wellbeing**, and that true prosperity comes from strong, stable 
communities rather than personal wealth hoarding.
