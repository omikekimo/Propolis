## Buyers

This department is concerned with the procurement of goods and services for 
all other departments of Propolis. While it should remain possible for 
departments to buy things autonomously the buyers should be monitoring such 
purchases and identifying overlap between internal entities and seeking any 
savings that can be retained. To internal members its activity will be 
apparent as an internal catalogue which should be consulted before looking 
elsewhere in the market for commodities or services which may have already 
been procured wholesale by the buyers and made available. If it is seen 
that a provider does a significant amount of trade with Propolis procedures 
should be in place to further incorporate their business with Propolis with 
a view to securing their long term prospects. By this mechanism Propolis 
can grow with organic profitability becoming self reciprocal internal 
profitability for Propolis with an extension of benefits afforded by 
membership or partnerships for the provider.

## Brokers

The task of the brokers in the context of Propolis is to familiarise 
themselves with the profitable enterprises undertaken by Propolis members 
and seek suitable work from the wider world on their behalf. Depending on 
the makeup of the enterprise pool this may be a diverse task and the 
distribution methods of such may vary widely. It is the responsibility of 
the brokers to systematise this distribution in the most efficient way for 
the operation of Propolis activities but with protocols designed to 
optimise Propolis response to differing situations. To illustrate, perhaps 
there are several tree surgeons working and sharing equipment in a 
standardised rota in a normal situation. In the event of a serious storm 
that causes damage to many trees near roads in a dangerous way, they could 
be deployed in a way more beneficial to clearing the roads quickly if 
organisational agility is predefined.

## Charitable Trust

Many of the activities of Propolis members will hopefully fall under 
categories that are generally held by many as worthwhile if not directly 
financially profitable. The prime example of this would be the entire 
education department, which deals in an intangible form of wealth, 
knowledge, which although is of tremendous value, is rarely of immediate 
monetary value. There are myriad others and Propolis would after a period 
of growth be able to partner with providers of such and provide tangible 
support. The responsibility of the charitable trust would be to accept 
donations that will support things such as the educational, social and 
cultural aspects of Propolis activity with a view to making them free at 
the point of use. One direction of charitable activity that may be wise to 
pursue is that of medicine, as healthcare systems seem to be non functional 
or being actively degraded a Propolis funded clinical practice and funding 
architecture may be necessary to support members medical needs. This need 
not be entirely exclusive to Propolis members when operational and could be 
an attractive feature for persuading individuals or organisations towards 
membership. Perhaps a simpler suggestion that might be better for testing 
the waters could be library's as they are in noticeably rapid decline 
despite overwhelming public support.

## Course Selectors

The course selectors will liaise between the educational and profitable 
enterprises management departments with a view to helping design and 
provide relevant educational material to the members engaged in profitable 
enterprises with the goal being improvements in services products and 
efficiency. Their purview will be towards evaluating and implementing pre-
existing available courses from external providers and to design and create 
courses for Propolis members to benefit their activities. They will design 
curricula for the faculty to teach and incorporate pre existing ones into 
the educational department so that Propolis members will be able to achieve 
both internally and externally recognised qualifications.

## Research Directors

The research directors are tasked with identifying areas of educational 
endeavour that should be prioritised to engender the greatest benefit to 
Propolis and its members. Identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the 
member pool and using this information to affect decisions within the 
educational sphere while being sensitive to the needs of all the 
constituent departments of Propolis will be the core activity of the 
research directors. Their work will enable the course directors and faculty 
to identify relevant material for the curriculums that they will design but 
the view in this department should not be on the minutiae of the topics 
covered but a broader view with long term goals in mind. These goals should 
be guided strongly by the ideals and values of Propolis as well as the 
needs of the organisation that by their nature are emergent and so will 
require diligent review.

## Advice Bureau

The complexity of Propolis and indeed the world at large can be daunting 
for any individual to engage with. This department should provide good 
quality advice to members on any topic without bias. The advice bureau 
should act as an interface between Propolis as an entity and its members 
when non standard communication is necessary. The department should be 
built with aiding members as its priority with its advisors able to act on 
behalf of members to resolve their dilemmas. These advisors should have the 
freedom to act within Propolis to achieve their outcomes and also to act as 
agents on behalf of members when external interactions are required.
