# Satellite Agencies

Satellite agencies support the main departments and facilitate their 
operations. Each main department influences two adjacent satellites.

## Buyers

### Purpose

This department is concerned with the procurement of goods and services for 
all other departments of Propolis.

### Operation

While it should remain possible for departments to buy things autonomously, 
the buyers should be:
- Monitoring such purchases
- Identifying overlap between internal entities
- Seeking any savings that can be retained

### Internal Catalogue

To internal members its activity will be apparent as an internal catalogue 
which should be consulted before looking elsewhere in the market for 
commodities or services which may have already been procured wholesale by 
the buyers and made available.

### Provider Integration

If it is seen that a provider does a significant amount of trade with 
Propolis, procedures should be in place to further incorporate their 
business with Propolis with a view to securing their long term prospects.

By this mechanism Propolis can grow with organic profitability becoming 
self-reciprocal internal profitability for Propolis with an extension of 
benefits afforded by membership or partnerships for the provider.

## Brokers

### Task

The task of the brokers in the context of Propolis is to familiarise 
themselves with the profitable enterprises undertaken by Propolis members 
and seek suitable work from the wider world on their behalf.

### Diverse Distribution

Depending on the makeup of the enterprise pool this may be a diverse task 
and the distribution methods of such may vary widely.

It is the responsibility of the brokers to systematise this distribution in 
the most efficient way for the operation of Propolis activities but with 
protocols designed to optimise Propolis response to differing situations.

### Example: Organisational Agility

Perhaps there are several tree surgeons working and sharing equipment in a 
standardised rota in a normal situation. In the event of a serious storm 
that causes damage to many trees near roads in a dangerous way, they could 
be deployed in a way more beneficial to clearing the roads quickly if 
organisational agility is predefined.

## Charitable Trust

### Supporting Worthwhile Activities

Many of the activities of Propolis members will hopefully fall under 
categories that are generally held by many as worthwhile if not directly 
financially profitable.

The prime example of this would be the entire education department, which 
deals in an intangible form of wealth - **knowledge** - which although is 
of tremendous value, is rarely of immediate monetary value.

### Funding Support Activities

The responsibility of the charitable trust would be to accept donations 
that will support things such as the educational, social and cultural 
aspects of Propolis activity with a view to making them free at the point 
of use.

### Healthcare Initiative

One direction of charitable activity that may be wise to pursue is that of 
medicine, as healthcare systems seem to be non-functional or being actively 
degraded. A Propolis funded clinical practice and funding architecture may 
be necessary to support members medical needs.

This need not be entirely exclusive to Propolis members when operational 
and could be an attractive feature for persuading individuals or 
organisations towards membership.

### Alternative: Libraries

Perhaps a simpler suggestion that might be better for testing the waters 
could be libraries as they are in noticeably rapid decline despite 
overwhelming public support.

## Course Selectors

### Liaison Role

The course selectors liaise between the educational and profitable 
enterprises management departments with a view to helping design and 
provide relevant educational material to the members engaged in profitable 
enterprises.

The goal is improvements in:
- Services
- Products
- Efficiency

### Responsibilities

Their purview includes:
- Evaluating and implementing pre-existing available courses from external 
providers
- Designing and creating courses for Propolis members to benefit their 
activities
- Designing curricula for the faculty to teach
- Incorporating pre-existing curricula into the educational department

This enables Propolis members to achieve both internally and externally 
recognised qualifications.

## Research Directors

### Strategic Educational Planning

The research directors are tasked with identifying areas of educational 
endeavour that should be prioritised to engender the greatest benefit to 
Propolis and its members.

### Core Activities

- Identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the member pool
- Using this information to affect decisions within the educational sphere
- Being sensitive to the needs of all the constituent departments of 
Propolis

### Long-term Focus

Their work enables the course directors and faculty to identify relevant 
material for the curriculums that they will design. The view in this 
department should not be on the minutiae of the topics covered but a 
broader view with long term goals in mind.

These goals should be guided strongly by:
- The ideals and values of Propolis
- The needs of the organisation (which by their nature are emergent and 
require diligent review)

## Advice Bureau

### Bridging Complexity

The complexity of Propolis and indeed the world at large can be daunting 
for any individual to engage with. This department should provide good 
quality advice to members on any topic without bias.

### Interface Function

The advice bureau should act as an interface between Propolis as an entity 
and its members when non-standard communication is necessary.

### Member Advocacy

The department should be built with **aiding members as its priority** with 
its advisors able to act on behalf of members to resolve their dilemmas.

These advisors should have:
- The freedom to act within Propolis to achieve their outcomes
- The ability to act as agents on behalf of members when external 
interactions are required
