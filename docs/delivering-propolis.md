# Delivering Propolis

It was mentioned in the introduction of this document that Propolis could 
be seen at one level as a social hub for businesses and entrepreneurs and 
workers to engage cooperatively in novel ways. To expand on this in terms 
of method, most of the basic functionality so far described could be 
implemented in software readily. For a lot of the functions there are 
currently working examples of things such as skill sharing, online banking, 
co-operatives, and much of the other functions we will need to implement. 
These could all be bought together and streamlined into an app or website 
that members use for their general management purposes within the 
organisation. Creating our own software as an early goal would give us the 
ability to implement and deliver relevant features such as messaging, VoIP 
and video conferencing, forums, document sharing and everything else for 
efficient running without the need to rely on external providers. It would 
also mean that Propolis could manage and protect the data of its members 
more effectively and provide a barrier to the worst practices of third 
party providers of similar functionality. There will be a requirement for 
human interaction throughout the whole structure of Propolis and it will be 
the goal of the software to connect everyone to everything they need to 
operate efficiently. This is especially true of the physical real world 
assets and actions and the software created should facilitate the actions 
of Propolis members and mostly stay out of their way so that they can focus 
on their core function or contribution. To this end the software should 
include features that make it easier for the end user to customise their 
communication and administrative experience. One feature that could be 
implemented in this spirit could be an answering service that gives callers 
a call appointment time rather than immediately disturbing the recipient. 
Tiered instant messaging could be another such innovation, whereby the user 
could predetermine who can message at certain times, with different 
categories for staff, customers, social etc with definable rules controlled 
by the user. To attempt to summarise the notion, in this software we can 
implement features that will benefit the user rather than the service 
provider because ultimately, by working through the Propolis framework the 
user, which is to say member, is the service provider. One important thing 
to consider when designing the software is that decentralisation is a key 
principle of Propolis. The software should be able to run a stand alone 
instance upon installation as well as communicate with other instances. It 
should therefore follow peer to peer principals in its implementation. 
Using this model will limit the unnecessary spread of member data around 
the network because the ad hoc nature of the network would necessitate the 
storage of user data locally rather than at a central server/location. 
There is a project that looks promising in terms of delivering such 
distributed functionality called Veilid which may be suitable to build the 
Propolis network infrastructure upon as well as technologies such as RDF 
and SPARQL which will be helpful in utilising data in a distributed 
setting. The software would however only be a first point of contact and 
while comprehensive, members should have alternate human routes to interact 
with the organisation such as mentors, agents, brokers, councillors, admin 
teams etc. These should have the ability to act with or on behalf of a 
member at their request to fulfil their needs if it becomes necessary. This 
will help provide a more holistic and personal approach to operations and 
importantly will give those who are digitally illiterate access to the 
network. It will also ensure continued operation in the event of electrical 
failure or other detrimental situations.
