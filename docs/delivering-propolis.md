# Delivering Propolis

## Software Implementation

It was mentioned in the introduction that Propolis could be seen at one 
level as a social hub for businesses and entrepreneurs and workers to 
engage cooperatively in novel ways.

### Basic Functionality in Software

Most of the basic functionality described could be implemented in software 
readily. For a lot of the functions there are currently working examples of 
things such as:
- Skill sharing
- Online banking
- Co-operatives
- And much of the other functions we will need to implement

### Streamlined Platform

These could all be brought together and streamlined into an app or website 
that members use for their general management purposes within the 
organisation.

## Benefits of Custom Software

### Independence from External Providers

Creating our own software as an early goal would give us the ability to 
implement and deliver relevant features such as:
- Messaging
- VoIP and video conferencing
- Forums
- Document sharing
- Everything else for efficient running

**Without the need to rely on external providers.**

### Data Protection

It would also mean that Propolis could:
- Manage and protect the data of its members more effectively
- Provide a barrier to the worst practices of third party providers of 
similar functionality

---

## Human Interaction

There will be a requirement for human interaction throughout the whole 
structure of Propolis and it will be the goal of the software to connect 
everyone to everything they need to operate efficiently.

### Software's Role

This is especially true of the physical real world assets and actions. The 
software created should:
- Facilitate the actions of Propolis members
- Mostly stay out of their way
- Allow them to focus on their core function or contribution

---

## User-Centric Features

### Customisation

To this end the software should include features that make it easier for 
the end user to customise their communication and administrative experience.

### Example Features

**Answering Service:** Gives callers a call appointment time rather than 
immediately disturbing the recipient.

**Tiered Instant Messaging:** The user could predetermine who can message 
at certain times, with different categories for:
- Staff
- Customers
- Social contacts
- Etc.

With definable rules controlled by the user.

### User-First Philosophy

In this software we can implement features that will **benefit the user 
rather than the service provider** because ultimately, by working through 
the Propolis framework the user (member) *is* the service provider.

---

## Decentralisation Principles

### Peer-to-Peer Architecture

One important thing to consider when designing the software is that 
**decentralisation is a key principle of Propolis**.

The software should be able to:
- Run a stand alone instance upon installation
- Communicate with other instances
- Follow peer to peer principles in its implementation

### Data Locality

Using this model will limit the unnecessary spread of member data around 
the network because the ad hoc nature of the network would necessitate the 
**storage of user data locally** rather than at a central server/location.

### Technology Considerations

There are projects that look promising in terms of delivering such 
distributed functionality:

- **Veilid** - May be suitable to build the Propolis network infrastructure 
upon
- **RDF and SPARQL** - Will be helpful in utilising data in a distributed 
setting

---

## Human Backup Systems

### Not Software-Only

The software would however only be a first point of contact and while 
comprehensive, members should have **alternate human routes** to interact 
with the organisation such as:

- Mentors
- Agents
- Brokers
- Councillors
- Admin teams
- Etc.

### Acting on Behalf of Members

These should have the ability to act with or on behalf of a member at their 
request to fulfil their needs if it becomes necessary.

### Benefits

This will help provide:
- A more holistic and personal approach to operations
- Access for those who are digitally illiterate
- Continued operation in the event of electrical failure or other 
detrimental situations

## Implementation Approach

### Phased Development

1. **Phase 1: Core functionality**
   - Member management
   - Basic communication tools
   - Simple project tracking

2. **Phase 2: Economic systems**
   - Internal marketplace
   - Skill matching
   - Resource sharing

3. **Phase 3: Advanced features**
   - Full credit union integration
   - Educational platform
   - Political coordination

4. **Phase 4: Decentralisation**
   - Peer-to-peer networking
   - Multi-instance coordination
   - Full data sovereignty

### Iterative Refinement

Each phase should be:
- Tested with real users
- Refined based on feedback
- Documented thoroughly
- Made available to other instances

The software should evolve based on member needs and real-world usage 
rather than theoretical requirements.
