# Councils

The councils function within Propolis as parliamentary bodies that are the 
governing chambers at the heart of Propolis. The method of accession is 
different for each by design in order to allow different personality and 
skill types to flourish from a suitable power base. This is necessary to 
ensure that there is a balanced decision making mechanism guiding Propolis 
that includes all thought types for no other reason than this is the 
optimum arrangement for achieving innovative thought. The fact that there 
is no overall leader of Propolis is deliberate, there would instead be 
three chairpersons of equal standing at the head of each council. The 
members of the councils would be selected individuals from the greater 
member pool by various methods detailed in the further sections. It should 
not be necessary for any of these councils to remain standing after they 
have fulfilled their current function. They should disband and reform 
regularly and only at times of constitutional need. During normal operation 
the councils should not be required to stand.

## Meritorious Council

The members of the meritorious council would be selected on their merit. 
This would be reckoned by success in education, finance, business or other 
beneficial fields with suitable competence metrics. A good deal of 
flexibility in the selection process should be applied as merit is not 
always apparent in such obvious ways as holding a PhD or owning a 
profitable business. All Propolis nodes should propose candidates for the 
meritorious council.

## Virtuous Council

The virtuous council is a democratically elected council, though distinct 
from the democratic elect of the political party. This council is to be 
composed of candidates that have campaigned for their place in the 
traditional democratic way and have won votes from the Propolis members. 
All members should be able to campaign to be included in the virtuous 
council.

## Statutory Council

The statutory council would comprise appointees selected for their 
technical acumen. It would comprise the most experienced members from 
any/all nodes with an onus on understanding of legality and regulatory 
material relevant to current discussion. Its formation would be based on 
expertise and its running would be of a technocratic nature.

Ordinary formation sessions for the councils need not be often but should 
be regular to ensure a stability of operation, Functions built into the 
organisation should be crafted to provide relevant information summaries so 
that council members are up to date with the state of operations in the 
form of suitably explained cited statistics. These statistics should be 
accessible by all council members. The councils should engage in debates 
both internally and in a cross council capacity, the scope of their powers 
individually or as a trinity should be defined and agreed upon by cross 
council debates and their conclusions and decisions would be added to the 
Ideas and Values agenda for final codification into the constitutional 
principles.
