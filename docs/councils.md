# Councils

The councils function within Propolis as parliamentary bodies that are the 
governing chambers at the heart of Propolis.

## Design Philosophy

### Different Paths to Power

The method of accession is different for each by design in order to allow 
different personality and skill types to flourish from a suitable power 
base.

This is necessary to ensure that there is a balanced decision making 
mechanism guiding Propolis that includes all thought types for no other 
reason than this is the optimum arrangement for achieving innovative 
thought.

### No Single Leader

The fact that there is **no overall leader of Propolis is deliberate**. 
There would instead be three chairpersons of equal standing at the head of 
each council.

The members of the councils would be selected individuals from the greater 
member pool by various methods detailed below.

### Not Permanently Standing

It should not be necessary for any of these councils to remain standing 
after they have fulfilled their current function. They should disband and 
reform regularly and only at times of constitutional need.

**During normal operation the councils should not be required to stand.**

## The Three Councils

### Meritorious Council

**Selection Method:** Based on merit

The members of the meritorious council would be selected on their merit. 
This would be reckoned by success in:
- Education
- Finance
- Business
- Other beneficial fields with suitable competence metrics

**Flexibility in Selection:** A good deal of flexibility in the selection 
process should be applied as merit is not always apparent in such obvious 
ways as holding a PhD or owning a profitable business.

**Nomination:** All Propolis nodes should propose candidates for the 
meritorious council.

### Virtuous Council

**Selection Method:** Democratic election

The virtuous council is a democratically elected council, though distinct 
from the democratic elect of the political party.

This council is to be composed of candidates that have:
- Campaigned for their place in the traditional democratic way
- Won votes from the Propolis members

**Eligibility:** All members should be able to campaign to be included in 
the virtuous council.

### Statutory Council

**Selection Method:** Technical appointment

The statutory council would comprise appointees selected for their 
technical acumen.

It would comprise the most experienced members from any/all nodes with an 
onus on understanding of:
- Legality
- Regulatory material relevant to current discussion

**Nature:** Its formation would be based on expertise and its running would 
be of a technocratic nature.

## Council Operations

### Formation Sessions

Ordinary formation sessions for the councils need not be often but should 
be regular to ensure a stability of operation.

### Information Access

Functions built into the organisation should be crafted to provide relevant 
information summaries so that council members are up to date with the state 
of operations in the form of suitably explained cited statistics.

**These statistics should be accessible by all council members.**

### Debates

The councils should engage in debates both:
- Internally (within each council)
- In a cross-council capacity (between councils)

### Powers and Decisions

The scope of their powers individually or as a trinity should be:
- Defined and agreed upon by cross-council debates
- Their conclusions and decisions would be added to the Ideas and Values 
agenda
- Final codification into the constitutional principles

This ensures that decisions are:
- Thoroughly debated from multiple perspectives
- Technically sound
- Democratically legitimate
- Merit-based

The three-council system prevents any single perspective from dominating 
while ensuring all major viewpoints (democratic, meritocratic, technical) 
are represented in governance decisions.
