# Economic Model

## Base Economic Functions

Propolis aims to be a versatile structure that can be applied to many 
diverse applications by and for the people that begin and operate any 
particular instance of it and as such it cannot be too specific in certain 
areas of operation.

### Flexible vs Fixed Components

The ideas and principles, political party, and education departments and 
their satellites are excluded from the base economic model because the 
nature of these departments will be heavily influenced by the purpose of 
the instance being created.

**Example:** An instance created to manage and upgrade the living standards 
of insurance industry focused members would have different needs than one 
focused on the green technology community.

### Universal Economic Foundation

There are areas of operation that can be more simply defined as they will 
be more broadly necessary. The base economic functions of Propolis 
instances should closely adhere to each other to maintain the possibility 
of interoperability.

This enables:
- Departments from different instances to become interchangeable
- Use of a protocol-based cascading economic networking structure
- Operation between departments, satellites, members, or any other type of 
Propolis node with great efficiency

## Advantages of Standardisation

### Skill Transferability

Members with appropriate departmental training would be able to transfer 
their skills between Propolis nodes without the necessity of acclimatising 
to a new system.

### Nested Instances

A nested instance of a Propolis structure which is managed within the 
profitable enterprises department of its parent instance could:
- Omit the creation of any unnecessary departments for its operation
- Retain access to these departments' functionality by having its members 
also be members of the parent instance
- Access all the benefits of Propolis membership without running extraneous 
departments

### Example: Minimal Instance

A team of graphic designers who choose to run on a Propolis framework would 
have no need of a political party, credit union or other nodes except the 
ones that will be used to manage their business.

**The minimum possible combination is:**
- Human Care and Development
- Profitable Enterprises

These two nodes should compose the minimum required to operate an instance 
of Propolis.

### Integration Support

Ideally these minimal instances would be in the previously stated 
parent/child nested enterprise configuration. However, that should not be a 
requirement as the widespread adoption of Propolis as a framework is to be 
desired.

Organisations that adopt framework compliance and meet set requirements 
should have made available to them a method of integration as a child 
instance of a larger more established instance.

### Benefits for Compliant Startups

Other beneficial services could be made available to Propolis Compliant 
startups such as:
- Credit union services (accounts and accountancy at desirable rates)
- Educational resources
- Administrative efficiency (freeing the startup's members to focus on core 
activity)

This is possible because the underlying system running the startup is well 
known from the outset because by definition they are compliant.

## Income and Costs

The economic mechanisms outlined should provide an outline of a complete 
organisation that has avenues for income and costs defined.

### Main Concerns

The main concerns (shown in rounded rectangles in the organisational 
diagram) can be seen as a combination of income and cost as they will have:
- Costly requirements
- Generation of income or stability for Propolis as a whole

### Colour Coding

In terms of the diagram representation:
- **Green** - Sources of income or valuable outcomes
- **Red** - Destinations for outgoings
- **Yellow** - Financial markets (state in flux)

The representation of the financial markets is coloured yellow because its 
state in terms of profitability will be in flux.

## Sustainability Model

While this illustrates the possibilities for sustainability that Propolis 
could utilise, there is by no means a fully comprehensive view of the full 
organisational model.

The economic mechanisms outlined should be strongly scrutinised and amended 
with rational improvements before deployment.

### Focus Areas

The focus is deliberately on:
1. **Base needs** - Economic mechanisms in place to deal with the base 
needs of members
2. **Economic stability** - Becoming economically stable from the outset
3. **Member-driven development** - Development of Propolis to be member 
driven as this is the only way to achieve a healthy open source ecosystem

The higher operations have been partially omitted from detailed economic 
diagrams as it will be important for the development of Propolis to be 
member driven.
