# Forward Strategy

Creating an organisation as complex as Propolis will need careful planning 
and robust procedures. This document provides a skeletal overview of the 
major economic functionalities and a brief glance at some of the 
philosophical and ethical ideals but it does not contain an adequate scope 
of information to be a complete model of how it will look in reality. There 
are two main reasons for this, firstly because currently this product is 
the product of one individual mind, and therefore the complete scope of all 
of the interactions of such an organisation is perhaps beyond the 
capabilities of that mind. Secondly and more importantly it will be 
essential that Propolis be defined and operated by the community that uses 
it in order that they may build into it the pathways protections they need 
to operate efficiently. In a practical sense this will initially require 
the formation of a community, tools for doing this exactly already exist 
and while the Propolis delivery software is currently un-built a server has 
been opened on the communication platform Discord.

The server link is:

While Discord has many features that will benefit Propolis in the early 
phases it should only be used as a stop-gap measure while the bespoke 
Propolis software is written.
