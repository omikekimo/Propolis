# Forward Strategy

## The Challenge Ahead

Creating an organisation as complex as Propolis will need careful planning 
and robust procedures.

This document provides:
- A skeletal overview of the major economic functionalities
- A brief glance at some of the philosophical and ethical ideals

**But it does not contain an adequate scope of information to be a complete 
model of how it will look in reality.**

## Why This Document is Incomplete

### Reason 1: Individual Limitations

Currently this product is the product of one individual mind, and therefore 
the complete scope of all of the interactions of such an organisation is 
perhaps beyond the capabilities of that mind.

### Reason 2: Community-Driven Design

**More importantly** it will be essential that Propolis be defined and 
operated by the community that uses it in order that they may build into it 
the pathways and protections they need to operate efficiently.

## Building the Community

### Initial Steps

In a practical sense this will initially require the formation of a 
community.

Tools for doing this exactly already exist and while the Propolis delivery 
software is currently unbuilt, a server has been opened on the 
communication platform Discord.

### Discord as Stop-Gap

**The Discord server:** [https://discord.gg/4vFSJfP](https://discord.gg/4vFSJfP)

While Discord has many features that will benefit Propolis in the early 
phases it should only be used as a **stop-gap measure** while the bespoke 
Propolis software is written.

## Critical Success Factors

### Member Buy-In

Success depends on members:
- Understanding the vision
- Believing in the principles
- Actively participating
- Supporting each other

### Practical Viability

The framework must:
- Solve real problems
- Provide tangible benefits
- Be operationally sound
- Demonstrate value quickly

### Ethical Consistency

Propolis must:
- Stay true to its principles
- Prioritise member wellbeing
- Operate transparently
- Resist corruption

### Technical Robustness

The software must:
- Be reliable and secure
- Respect user privacy
- Scale effectively
- Remain maintainable

---

## Realistic Expectations

### This Will Take Time

Building an alternative economic system is not quick or easy. We should 
expect:
- Years of development
- Many iterations and failures
- Continuous learning
- Gradual growth

### This Requires Commitment

Success requires:
- Dedicated founding members
- Sustained effort
- Patience with setbacks
- Long-term thinking

### This Needs Resources

While designed to be self-sustaining, initial development requires:
- Time (the most precious resource)
- Some capital for legal/technical work
- Skills across many domains
- Community goodwill

---

## The Path Forward

The journey from specification to reality is long but achievable. By:

1. **Building a committed community**
2. **Developing robust software**
3. **Establishing legal foundations**
4. **Launching a working instance**
5. **Learning and iterating**
6. **Expanding the network**

We can create a viable alternative to current economic systems that truly 
serves its members rather than exploiting them.

**The time to start is now. Join us.**
