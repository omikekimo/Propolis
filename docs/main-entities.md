# Main Entities

## Credit Union

Propolis seeks initially to exist as an operating layer set upon a 
capitalist foundation and as such requires a financial backbone to support 
infrastructure/overheads and pay its members. The use of external financial 
agencies such as loans, trust funds and investments is typically how this 
is achieved by contemporary organisations, however the unorthodox 
architecture of a Propolis like organisation will be initially unattractive 
for the provision of such by extant institutions. A workable solution would 
be for a single credit union to be formed that would reinvest in Propolis 
activities. For the members it would be identical to traditional banking 
but the financial products offered would be of substantially better value 
and should Propolis begin to thrive dividends would be paid into the 
members accounts. The goal would be to provide a financial feed-back loop 
where wages/dividends paid remain in some portion available to Propolis as 
investment capital while remaining completely available to members as their 
autonomous personal finance. Once this loop is in operation it can fund the 
further operation of Propolis activities. The credit union formed by the 
first or prime Propolis instance should codify the formation of similar 
credit unions and provide a mechanism for hosting such credit unions to 
simplify the process of instantiating Propolis based operations 
subsequently. This should not be essential as external factors may make 
such interconnected capital impossible, it should be possible to 
instantiate and operate a Propolis based organisation as a stand alone 
organisation or as an interconnected node in a broader network with the 
ability to separate, be forcibly separated or reconnect with minimal chaos. 
The goal of the credit union capital is to allow Propolis to act as a 
viable and capable entity within a capitalist environment.

While financial interactions should remain possible between Propolis 
members and organisational nodes they should not be preferred as ultimately 
it benefits all members that other members are supported because the 
connected investment capital that supplies dividends to members and 
allocates budget for nodal entities is ultimately dependant on the amount 
of capital the credit union has. Instead where possible it should be that 
the needs of members are met by other members using the internal wealth 
distributions we create to keep all of the value associated with such 
transactions in-house and therefore under the scrutiny and control of the 
credit union teams.

The credit union will be headed by a committee that manages and monitors 
value of internal and external transactions to provide services and 
analytics to keep the internal economy of Propolis stable. The forms of 
wealth taken into account by this department are more holistic than just 
finance because true wealth is more than just finance. Propolis will need 
to pioneer new thinking on wealth and fairness because relying on money as 
the only measure of wealth is a vulnerable position when seen in the light 
of massive financial devaluation that can be caused by external factors not 
in any individual or organisations control. One possible solution may be an 
explicit privilege system where earned privileges open access to resources 
for members within the network, there may be better alternatives to this 
suggestion but new thinking is required in this regard because commerce and 
finance is an outdated system that has proven to be massively exploitable.

## Profitable Enterprises

Profitable enterprises undertaken by Propolis will follow many forms and 
models. Some will be directly created by and for Propolis as an entity 
while others will have their origins as pre-existing businesses owned by 
members. The goal will be to create a structure that can interface many 
types of organisation into the main Propolis infrastructure and to 
facilitate efficient interoperation of them. The benefits of having such a 
structure will be bourne out by giving each enterprise the ability to 
dynamically scale aspects of its operation as necessary, greatly reduce its 
admin overhead and provide managerial assistance when required. The goal is 
ultimately to cooperate using such methods to alleviate excessive expense 
within the overall organisation. Instead exchanges within Propolis should 
be direct in their value, be it for an abstract such as labour or a 
tangible product the object of Propolis is to allow an interconnected web 
of autonomous actors to behave as if they are a much larger organisation 
and to enjoy the benefits that may be associated with such. Any skill base 
that Propolis acquires through initiating new members could be added to an 
organised database that could be utilised to introduce appropriate members 
or nodes to accelerate talent finding within the organisation with the 
ultimate aim being a streamlined skill sharing talent pool that empowers 
all members to be able to accept larger more profitable works than they 
would normally knowing that a plethora of valuable skill and resource can 
be called upon if needed. In essence, small enterprises working through 
Propolis can behave as a department in a larger organisation. Indeed to be 
integrated as a part of Propolis it will have been calculated that all 
members have a value above a certain threshold and while they may sometimes 
need to utilise additional help or may respond to a call for such. So for 
example, a graphic designer may be asked to build a website for one of 
their existing clients. While this may be outside their skill base they 
will be able to agree to take on the project, knowing that there are those 
with the skills needed within the organisation that can take on such work. 
As the network grows so does the value of being in the network.

The profitable enterprises as a whole will be overseen by a project 
management committee who should act to attract or create profitable 
enterprises with skill overlap with existing ones or to fill skill gaps 
with a view to creating a interconnected web of members able to 
holistically approach a variety of challenges without the need to call upon 
outside entities. The department should be able to host and interact with 
legacy organisations, for example an established engineering firm may want 
to integrate into Propolis but they are running on a traditional hierarchy. 
There should be an integration protocol and then a restructuring assessment 
protocol to expedite their inclusion and then to impart the benefits of 
membership in a controlled and guided way.

## Human Care and Development

This department will be the replacement for what other organisations might 
term human resources, but with an onus to making life easier for the 
Propolis member so that they can focus on their preferred main endeavour. 
The operational standards committee that head this department are 
responsible for the internal procedures and protocols of Propolis, this 
includes internal operations and those between separate Propolis instances.

An important function of this department would be that any interaction 
between Propolis members and external entities can be mediated through this 
department at the members request and it should aim to be able to act as an 
agent for all aspects of human care such as legal, medical, living support, 
childcare etc. A network of suitable providers should be internally built 
and curated in this department and as they will necessarily be qualified 
they will have great overlap with other aspects of Propolis perhaps as 
profitable enterprises or as educators. It is important that this 
department by default sides with the individual that comes to them 
initially and efforts are made to ensure that the best outcomes can be 
reached with an onus on safeguarding the well-being of the individual.

## Education

It is an obvious and objective fact that vital knowledge has been omitted 
from the education of most people and that the quality of general education 
standards have been in decline for decades. A major goal of Propolis will 
be to make up that shortfall by the creation of an educational institute 
that seeks to aid and guide the development of Propolis members. Initially 
the faculty should focus on fields related to the members' needs with those 
topics that have the greatest overlap gaining the greatest priority.

A secondary goal of Propolis would be to educate the general population 
more broadly. Where possible the inclusion of wider community members 
should be considered for educational events and forums. This is especially 
true where such crossover could be used to engage the public with Propolis 
activities and bring networking and awareness raising opportunities.

## Ideas and Values

The ideas and values that constitute Propolis both in spirit and in 
practice need to be specific, thought out, organised and accessible. The 
lack of a coherent constitution in any organisational structure inevitably 
leads to abuses and failures at critical times. The structure of Propolis 
should make avoiding such abuses more effective by providing multiple 
routes of internal communication as opposed to a traditional single channel 
upwards which is the norm in hierarchies. Careful management of the rules 
that guide action or any activity undertaken by or for Propolis is 
essential to maintain Propolis as a fair organisation. A goal for this 
department would be to find the most minimal set of laws essential for a 
functioning business/social structure and to produce cogent guidelines so 
that other departments can operate with the confidence of clear direction. 
With the variety of members requirements being fulfilled by Propolis 
outstretching those that a more typical organisation might envisage 
managing, the constitutional principles of Propolis should be broad in 
their approach with specifics being handled interdepartmentally. Where 
Propolis seeks to run a reduced set of laws and rules their focus should 
remain fixed on and prioritise the safeguarding of members well-being in a 
holistic way.

The department should operate as a debate forum and be guided by informed 
ethical discussion with internal council members. Additionally this 
department will act as a codifying and archival service similar in function 
to a civil service at a more operational level. It will be responsible for 
tangibly enacting the conclusions of the council sessions wherefrom the 
actual ideals and principles being managed in this department are derived. 
The councils will be constituted of members enrolled from the management 
committees from the greater organisational components of Propolis. More 
detail on the councils themselves will be included in further sections of 
this document.

## Political Party

Propolis seeks to interact with the world at every level thus a requirement 
for such is the ability to act within the political sphere. It is not 
necessary for the party to resemble any extant similar organisation as they 
for the most part are fundamentally flawed. This is meant both in terms of 
organisation and policy. Policy pursued by the party should be guided by 
the greater ethics of Propolis and thus the best outcome for the majority 
and not sullied by idealism. Objectivity should be favoured over political 
tribalism with fairness as the goal. Unashamedly plagiarising the best 
policies from every political standpoint anywhere should not be viewed as a 
bad thing but in fact lauded if found to be effective and provide most 
benefit.
