# Main Entities

The six main departments of Propolis are all stand-alone organisations 
within themselves that cooperate and communicate both internally and 
externally.

## Credit Union

### Purpose

Propolis seeks initially to exist as an operating layer set upon a 
capitalist foundation and as such requires a financial backbone to support 
infrastructure/overheads and pay its members.

The use of external financial agencies such as loans, trust funds and 
investments is typically how this is achieved by contemporary 
organisations. However, the unorthodox architecture of a Propolis-like 
organisation will be initially unattractive for the provision of such by 
extant institutions.

### Solution

A workable solution would be for a single credit union to be formed that 
would reinvest in Propolis activities. For the members it would be 
identical to traditional banking but the financial products offered would 
be of substantially better value and should Propolis begin to thrive 
dividends would be paid into the members accounts.

### The Financial Feedback Loop

The goal is to provide a financial feed-back loop where:

1. Wages/dividends paid remain in some portion available to Propolis as 
investment capital
2. While remaining completely available to members as their autonomous 
personal finance
3. Once operational, it funds further Propolis activities

### Replication and Independence

The credit union formed by the first or prime Propolis instance should 
codify the formation of similar credit unions and provide a mechanism for 
hosting such credit unions to simplify the process of instantiating 
Propolis based operations subsequently.

This should not be essential - it should be possible to instantiate and 
operate a Propolis based organisation as:
- A stand alone organisation
- An interconnected node in a broader network
- With the ability to separate, be forcibly separated, or reconnect with 
minimal chaos

### Internal Economy

While financial interactions should remain possible between Propolis 
members and organisational nodes, they should not be preferred. It benefits 
all members that other members are supported because the connected 
investment capital that supplies dividends and allocates budget is 
ultimately dependant on the amount of capital the credit union has.

Where possible, the needs of members should be met by other members using 
internal wealth distributions to keep all value associated with such 
transactions in-house and therefore under the scrutiny and control of the 
credit union teams.

### Holistic Wealth Management

The credit union is headed by a committee that manages and monitors value 
of internal and external transactions to provide services and analytics to 
keep the internal economy of Propolis stable.

**The forms of wealth are more holistic than just finance** - true wealth 
is more than money. Propolis will need to pioneer new thinking on wealth 
and fairness because relying on money as the only measure of wealth is 
vulnerable to massive financial devaluation caused by external factors not 
in any individual or organisation's control.

One possible solution may be an **explicit privilege system** where earned 
privileges open access to resources for members within the network. New 
thinking is required because commerce and finance is an outdated system 
that has proven to be massively exploitable.

## Profitable Enterprises

### Many Forms and Models

Profitable enterprises undertaken by Propolis will follow many forms. Some 
will be directly created by and for Propolis as an entity while others will 
have their origins as pre-existing businesses owned by members.

The goal is to create a structure that can interface many types of 
organisation into the main Propolis infrastructure and facilitate efficient 
interoperation of them.

### Benefits

Having such a structure provides each enterprise the ability to:

- **Dynamically scale** aspects of its operation as necessary
- **Greatly reduce admin overhead**
- **Receive managerial assistance** when required

The goal is ultimately to cooperate using such methods to alleviate 
excessive expense within the overall organisation.

### Skill Pool and Talent Sharing

Any skill base that Propolis acquires through initiating new members could 
be added to an organised database utilised to introduce appropriate members 
or nodes to accelerate talent finding within the organisation.

The ultimate aim is a **streamlined skill sharing talent pool** that 
empowers all members to be able to accept larger more profitable works than 
they would normally, knowing that a plethora of valuable skill and resource 
can be called upon if needed.

**Example:** A graphic designer may be asked to build a website for one of 
their existing clients. While this may be outside their skill base they 
will be able to agree to take on the project, knowing that there are those 
with the skills needed within the organisation that can take on such work.

In essence, small enterprises working through Propolis can behave as a 
department in a larger organisation. As the network grows, so does the 
value of being in the network.

### Project Management Oversight

The profitable enterprises as a whole are overseen by a project management 
committee who should act to:

- Attract or create profitable enterprises with skill overlap with existing 
ones
- Fill skill gaps
- Create an interconnected web of members able to holistically approach a 
variety of challenges without the need to call upon outside entities

### Legacy Organisation Integration

The department should be able to host and interact with legacy 
organisations. For example, an established engineering firm may want to 
integrate into Propolis but they are running on a traditional hierarchy.

There should be:
- An **integration protocol** to expedite their inclusion
- A **restructuring assessment protocol** to impart the benefits of 
membership in a controlled and guided way

## Human Care and Development

### Beyond Human Resources

This department is the replacement for what other organisations might term 
human resources, but with an onus to making life easier for the Propolis 
member so that they can focus on their preferred main endeavour.

The operational standards committee that heads this department is 
responsible for the internal procedures and protocols of Propolis, 
including:
- Internal operations
- Operations between separate Propolis instances

### Member Support Services

An important function of this department is that any interaction between 
Propolis members and external entities can be mediated through this 
department at the member's request.

It should aim to act as an agent for all aspects of human care such as:
- Legal support
- Medical assistance
- Living support
- Childcare
- And more

A network of suitable providers should be internally built and curated in 
this department. As they will necessarily be qualified they will have great 
overlap with other aspects of Propolis - perhaps as profitable enterprises 
or as educators.

### Member-First Approach

It is important that this department by default sides with the individual 
that comes to them initially and efforts are made to ensure that the best 
outcomes can be reached with an onus on **safeguarding the well-being of 
the individual**.

## Education

### Addressing the Educational Deficit

It is an obvious and objective fact that vital knowledge has been omitted 
from the education of most people and that the quality of general education 
standards have been in decline for decades.

A major goal of Propolis is to make up that shortfall by the creation of an 
educational institute that seeks to aid and guide the development of 
Propolis members.

### Priority Focus

Initially the faculty should focus on fields related to the members' needs 
with those topics that have the greatest overlap gaining the greatest 
priority.

### Community Engagement

A secondary goal of Propolis would be to educate the general population 
more broadly. Where possible, the inclusion of wider community members 
should be considered for educational events and forums.

This is especially true where such crossover could be used to:
- Engage the public with Propolis activities
- Bring networking opportunities
- Raise awareness

## Ideas and Values

### The Need for a Clear Constitution

The ideas and values that constitute Propolis both in spirit and in 
practice need to be specific, thought out, organised and accessible. The 
lack of a coherent constitution in any organisational structure inevitably 
leads to abuses and failures at critical times.

The structure of Propolis should make avoiding such abuses more effective 
by providing **multiple routes of internal communication** as opposed to a 
traditional single channel upwards which is the norm in hierarchies.

### Minimal Law Approach

A goal for this department would be to find the most minimal set of laws 
essential for a functioning business/social structure and to produce cogent 
guidelines so that other departments can operate with the confidence of 
clear direction.

With the variety of members requirements being fulfilled by Propolis 
outstretching those that a more typical organisation might envisage 
managing, the constitutional principles of Propolis should be:
- Broad in their approach
- With specifics being handled interdepartmentally
- Focused on and prioritising the safeguarding of members well-being in a 
holistic way

### Debate Forum and Codification

The department should operate as a debate forum and be guided by informed 
ethical discussion with internal council members.

Additionally this department will act as a **codifying and archival 
service** similar in function to a civil service at a more operational 
level. It will be responsible for tangibly enacting the conclusions of the 
council sessions wherefrom the actual ideals and principles being managed 
in this department are derived.

The councils are constituted of members enrolled from the management 
committees from the greater organisational components of Propolis.

## Political Party

### Operating in the Political Sphere

Propolis seeks to interact with the world at every level thus a requirement 
for such is the ability to act within the political sphere.

It is not necessary for the party to resemble any extant similar 
organisation as they for the most part are fundamentally flawed - both in 
terms of organisation and policy.

### Policy Principles

Policy pursued by the party should be guided by the greater ethics of 
Propolis and thus the best outcome for the majority and not sullied by 
idealism.

**Objectivity should be favoured over political tribalism** with fairness 
as the goal.

Unashamedly plagiarising the best policies from every political standpoint 
anywhere should not be viewed as a bad thing but in fact lauded if found to 
be effective and provide most benefit.
