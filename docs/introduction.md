# Introduction

Propolis will integrate work, education, ideals and values, politics, 
social services and financial services plus related activities and 
processes with a focus on interoperation of these elements to achieve 
progressive outcomes for people. Importantly, Propolis seeks to operate 
alongside or inside extant organisations or systems but to have the 
capability of integrating those organisations as nodes within Propolis or 
replacing those systems. Procedures and protocols for engagement and 
communication must therefore be specified. The open source nature of the 
organisation should ensure these are ethically derived but to ensure the 
fluidity of intersectional decision making a robust yet greatly reduced set 
of fundamental instructions (laws) should be implemented with guidance 
emerging from the discourse of qualified councils or ethics committees. 
Propolis should be implemented in the most decentralised way possible to 
remain agile and active yet must simultaneously be consistent and unified 
in its approaches. Some committees may need to remain standing to maintain 
the core procedures/protocols but others may be formed and dissolved as 
necessary. The main goal of Propolis is to improve the quality of life, 
stability and social cohesion of its members and to the communities it 
interacts with. Any protocols enacted should be reactive to the real states 
people are naturally in rather than driving towards a state that is skewed 
towards targets and ideals or benefiting the organisation at the expense of 
the individual. Likewise the protocols should be minimalistic and ethically 
driven so as not to benefit the rights/freedoms/responsibilities of one 
individual over another. In fact the safeguarding of the well-being of 
Propolis members is a priority concern and should be reflected in any 
activity or decision. The protocols and procedures should mimic those found 
in computer networks and systems in that they should remain in operation 
even if certain nodes or connections become inoperative (later in the 
'Sustaining Propolis' section of this document nodes and sub-nodes are 
defined fully). Where possible the procedures and practices we develop 
should be operable as stand alone functionality that existing organisations 
can adopt either autonomously or under guidance either to improve their own 
internal efficiency or in order to interface/integrate/reorganise into a 
Propolis like organisational structure.

The operation of Propolis on a basic level from the standpoint of a typical 
member could be seen as a social hub for businesses, entrepreneurs and 
workers to engage cooperatively in novel ways within an overarching 
structure that removes many of the hurdles that can stand in the way of 
such interactions and activities while at the same time offering tremendous 
benefits that would not otherwise be available. Such benefits would 
resemble those enjoyed by larger organisations but not be limited to them 
as profits are redirected back into the organisation allowing for a broader 
scope in initiatives. The member would have access to these initiatives 
while maintaining their ultimate autonomy. One core initiative would be a 
worker-jobs pool to connect talent to projects, models to study for the 
implementation of a successful instance of such exist in the history of 
fisheries employment practices for instance, and today on freelance 
contract aggregator sites. Assistance with the management of accommodation 
or domestic utilities could also benefit the typical member, the scope of 
this should be seen holistically with the goal of reducing the stresses of 
an individual member. This will be achieved by implementing an advanced 
resource sharing network between members. Shown here is an organisational 
structure diagram outlining a complete Propolis organisation. The six main 
departments are all stand alone organisations within themselves that 
cooperate and communicate internally either directly or via the internal 
councils and externally either directly or via a satellite proxy, of which 
each main department influences the two adjacent satellites. The names used 
here are descriptive and could be changed.
