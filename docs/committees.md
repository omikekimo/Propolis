# Committees

Management committees coordinate the activities of departments and provide 
oversight and direction.

## Internal Value Management

### Primary Function

The internal value management board is placed at the head of the credit 
union. Their primary function is to run it efficiently as a bank for the 
members and departments of Propolis.

This board will have access to the financial goings on of Propolis as a 
whole and their activities should help gear Propolis towards greater 
financial efficiency.

### Beyond Simple Transactions

Where a traditional bank would benefit by an increased number of 
transactions, in terms of internal trading **Propolis would benefit from 
minimising such**.

To achieve this the internal value management board is tasked with 
identifying and managing less tangible forms of wealth than simple monetary 
wealth.

### Holistic Wealth Recognition

Some of these things are obvious - for example an individual with a lot of 
free time might be seen as better off than someone that has a completely 
full schedule.

The department may decide where skill overlaps exist to contact such 
members and cause them to collaborate to rebalance their work/free-time so 
that members are exerting an equal amount of effort.

### Inclusive Definition of Value

Propolis seeks to provide a more inclusive definition of value in terms of 
what is seen as valuable to Propolis. This should explicitly include things 
such as:

- Housekeeping
- Care provision
- Home maintenance
- Parenting
- Other activities that while beneficial to humans, are not traditionally 
seen as profitable

### Equalising Wealth

Identifying effort discrepancies and valued activities like these and 
helping members redistribute their labours with a view to **equalising 
actual wealth in all its forms** across the member pool is a major goal of 
this department.

## Project Management

### Standardisation and Tracking

All departments, committees, councils, agencies, boards and members will 
engage in projects. The Project management board is tasked with:

- Creating a standard form for Propolis projects to follow
- Creating a system to track projects through inception to completion

### Project Mentorship

The provision of project mentors from this department should enable the 
best use of Propolis resources for projects being run.

Placed at the helm of the profitable enterprises department, the project 
management board will be able to survey the requirements of running 
projects and enterprises.

### Encouraging Cooperation

Where overlaps are detected, project mentors should encourage and 
facilitate cooperation between such enterprises to increase efficiency 
across the organisation.

### Metrics and Analytics

The department should produce thorough and useful metrics that are to be 
made available to inform Propolis strategies to the best possible standard.

## Operational Standards Committee

### Defining Interactivity

Without proper definition none of the conceptual components of Propolis 
will be able to interact or operate to a useful level.

The operational standards committee is tasked with:
- Defining the parameters of interactivity for all nodes within Propolis
- To some extent, communication with external nodes

### Procedures Manual

The committee will author and maintain the procedures and processes that 
form the operations of Propolis into a **procedures manual** that is 
available for all members.

This is necessary so that Propolis can have a uniform and reliable 
operational paradigm which is transparent and accessible to members.

### Streamlining Through Codification

The goal is to streamline activities across the organisation by codifying 
operations and exploiting any potential advantages that can be gleaned by 
taking such metrics.

## Faculty

### Delivering Education

The faculty is the collection of teachers and tutors who are tasked with 
delivering educational materials to Propolis members.

They will deliver:
- Courses designed by Propolis
- Where possible, courses from external sources and examination boards

### Novel Teaching Models

The format in which they teach need not be a rigid classroom model but 
should look into novel models of teaching and apply the best practices 
learned from them.

## Constitutional Principles Board

### Two Chief Goals

The board presiding over the constitutional principles of Propolis is 
tasked with:

1. **Presiding over debate functions** pertaining to ideals and values
2. **Consolidating consensus** achieved through debates and empirical trial 
into a concise constitution

### The Constitution Document

This document should be:
- Consistent
- Clearly written
- Accessible

### Approachable and Responsive

The board should be:
- Open
- Responsive
- Approachable by all members of Propolis

The board and the wider department they head should at all times work to 
guide Propolis activities to the greatest benefit.

## Democratic Elect

### Political Representation

The democratic elect are selected by the members that choose to interact 
with Propolis in its capacity as a political party.

### Task

Their task is to:
- Gauge the political feelings of members
- Form the most representative manifesto they are able to produce
- Present it to its relevant audience (members or the wider public)

### Pragmatism vs Idealism

In order to remain electable it should not be necessary for the political 
party to operate completely within the boundaries set by the ideals and 
values.

This necessitates the creation of a **robust mechanism for justifying 
differences** between ideals and workable policies.

This is essential because the wider electorate should be persuaded to adopt 
Propolis principles on merit, never forced.
