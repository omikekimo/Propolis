# Committees

## Internal Value Management

The internal value management board are placed at the head of the credit 
union and their primary function is to run it efficiently as a bank for the 
members and departments of Propolis. This board will have access to the 
financial goings on of Propolis as a whole and their activities should help 
gear Propolis towards greater financial efficiency. Where a traditional 
bank would benefit by an increased number of transactions, in terms of 
internal trading Propolis would benefit from minimising such. To achieve 
this the internal value management board is tasked with identifying and 
managing less tangible forms of wealth than simple monetary wealth. Some of 
these things are obvious, for example an individual with a lot of free time 
might be seen as better off than someone that has a completely full 
schedule. The department may decide where skill overlaps exist to contact 
such members and cause them to collaborate to rebalance their work/free-
time so that members are exerting an equal amount of effort. Propolis seeks 
to provide a more inclusive definition of value in terms of what is seen as 
valuable to Propolis. This should explicitly include things such as 
housekeeping, care provision, home maintenance, parenting and other such 
activities that while beneficial to humans, are not traditionally seen as 
profitable. Identifying effort discrepancies and valued activities like 
these and helping members redistribute their labours with a view to 
equalising actual wealth in all its forms across the member pool is a major 
goal of this department.

## Project Management

All departments committees councils agencies boards and members will engage 
in projects. The Project management board are tasked with creating a 
standard form for Propolis projects to follow and then a system to track 
projects through inception to completion. The provision of project mentors 
from this department should enable the best use of Propolis resources for 
projects being run. Placed at the helm of the profitable enterprises 
department the project management board will be able to survey the 
requirements of running projects and enterprises. Where overlaps are 
detected project mentors should encourage and facilitate cooperation 
between such enterprises to increase efficiency across the organisation. 
The department should produce thorough and useful metrics that are to be 
made available to inform Propolis strategies to the best possible standard.

## Operational Standards Committee

Without proper definition none of the conceptual components of Propolis 
will be able to interact or operate to a useful level. The operational 
standards committee is tasked with defining the parameters of interactivity 
for all nodes within Propolis and to some extent communication with 
external ones. The committee will author and maintain the procedures and 
processes that form the operations of Propolis into a procedures manual 
that is available for all members. This is necessary so that Propolis can 
have a uniform and reliable operational paradigm which is transparent and 
accessible to members. The goal is to streamline activities across the 
organisation by codifying operations and exploiting any potential 
advantages that can be gleaned by taking such metrics.

## Faculty

The faculty is the collection of teachers and tutors who are tasked with 
delivering educational materials to Propolis members. They will deliver the 
courses designed by Propolis and also where possible courses from external 
sources and examination boards. The format in which they teach need not be 
a rigid classroom model but should look into novel models of teaching and 
apply the best practices learned from them.

## Constitutional Principals

The board presiding over the constitutional principles of Propolis are 
tasked with two chief goals. Firstly to preside over the debate functions 
pertaining to ideals and values and secondly to consolidate the consensus 
achieved through debates and empirical trial into a concise constitution. 
This document should be consistent, clearly written and accessible. The 
board should be open, responsive and approachable by all members of 
Propolis. The board and the wider department they head should at all times 
work to guide Propolis activities to the greatest benefit.

## Democratic Elect

The democratic elect are selected by the members that choose to interact 
with Propolis in its capacity as a political party. Their task is to gauge 
the political feelings of members and form the most representative 
manifesto they are able to produce and to present it to its relevant 
audience, which will be members or the wider public. In order to remain 
electable it should not be necessary for the political party to operate 
completely within the boundaries set by the ideals and values. This will 
necessitate the creation of a robust mechanism for justifying differences 
between ideals and workable policies but it is essential because the wider 
electorate should be persuaded to adopt Propolis principles on merit, never 
forced.
