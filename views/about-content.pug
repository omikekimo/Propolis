p Propolis is an open source framework for instantiating a network of decentralised autonomous organisations designed to provide its members with a higher state of living than is currently available to most people during the capitalist decline. We will actively use information and policies acquired from traditional and novel sources to model a sustainable work/life paradigm which will be beneficial to the humans involved. The organisation will dynamically form structures to promote and execute profitable enterprises, profits from such activities will be retained for use by the members/workers/Propolis rather than being sent to shareholders as is the incumbent paradigm. With co-operative development as seen in the open source movement which has resulted in massive successes in the technology sector alongside successes evident from existing co-operative organisations in many sectors, we seek to develop Propolis into a scalable social operating system suitable to supplement or replace legacy governance and regulatory systems.
